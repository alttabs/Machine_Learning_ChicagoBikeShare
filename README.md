# Machine_Learning_ChicagoBikeShare
Project from Udacity Machine Learn and IA Nanodegree - Python to explore data related to bicycle sharing systems in the three largest cities in the United States: Chicago, New York and Washington.

In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bicycle sharing systems in the three largest cities in the United States: Chicago, New York and Washington. The code imports data and answers interesting questions about it through the computation of descriptive statistics. The script that receives a raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal in order to display these statistics.

## Running the Script
Launch the ```chicago_bikeshare_pt.py``` file from your terminal and you will see a prompt that will guide your experience reviewing the bikeshare data and reading relevant data analysis.
1. Clone or Download the repository
2. Unompress chicago.zip
3. Run terminal
4. Navegate to the project repository
5. ```python chicago_bikeshare_pt.py```

## Data
Data for the first six months of 2017 are provided. The data file contains six (6) main columns:

- Start time (eg, 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End time (eg, 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip duration (in seconds, eg 776)
- Initial season (eg, Broadway & Barry Avenue)
- End Station (eg, Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- Type of user (subscriber or client)
- User Gender
- Year of birth of the user

## Questions

- Task 1: Show the first 20 samples (rows) of the database
- Task 2: Show the genus (column) of the first 20 samples
- Task 3: Create a function to paste columns as list
- Task 4: Count how many people of each gender
- Task 5: Create a function to count the genres
- Task 6: Show the most popular genre
- Task 7: Display a graph using the previous data
- Task 8: Answer the reason the number of men and women did not hit with the amount of samples
- Task 9: Find the minimum, maximum, average and median travel duration
- Task 10: Show all database stations
- Task 11: Check if you have documented all of your roles
- Task 12: Create a function that counts the occurrence of any column (optional)
